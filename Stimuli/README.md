Images in this task were created by Jonathan Ahern consistant with previous the action control cordiantion task used in previous work [(Gordon et. al. 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05964-2)[^1]. Specific care has been taken to adapt these methods to a pediatric population and ustilize guidelines identified in previous works [(Raschle et. al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.3791/1309) & [Wilke et. al. 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.658)[^2][^3]. 

These images were created using Adobe illustrator. Illustratior files can be found in in the `illustrator_files` subdirectory.
