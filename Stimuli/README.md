Images in this task were created by [Jonathan Ahern](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6pU5U5gAAAAJ&hl=en) (jahern@ucsd.edu) consistent with the movement task battery and action control coordination task used in previous work [(Gordon et. al. 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05964-2)[^1]. Specific care has been taken to adapt these methods to a pediatric population and utilize guidelines identified in previous works [(Raschle et. al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.3791/1309) & [Wilke et. al. 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.658)[^2][^3]. 

Additional information regarding the task can be found in the `README.md` in the main directory.

Visual stimuli were created using Adobe Illustrator. Illustrator files can be found in the `illustrator_files` subdirectory.

Sound stimuli were gotten from [zapsplat.com](zapsplat.com) which offers free sound effects for both commercial and non comercial use. Sounds can be downloaded from by clicking following links:
